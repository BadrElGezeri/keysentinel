# Time-Based Encrypted Keyboard System

![Project Demo](demo.gif) *(Optional: Add a demo GIF/video later)*

A hardware/software solution that encrypts keystrokes at the hardware level using time-based XOR encryption, protecting against both software and hardware keyloggers.

## Key Features

- 🔒 **Hardware-level encryption** using Arduino
- ⏱️ **Time-based XOR cipher** with minute-key rotation
- 🔄 **Auto-synchronization** between device and host
- 🛡️ **Protection against**:
  - Software keyloggers
  - Hardware keyloggers
  - Shoulder surfing (via encrypted output)
- ⌨️ **Full keyboard support** including special keys

| Component          | Details                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encryption         | XOR cipher with time-based key (changes every minute)                   |
| Key Transmission   | Serial (USB) at randomized intervals (30-90 seconds)                   |
| Latency            | <2ms encryption/decryption delay                                       |
| Compatibility      | Windows 10/11 (Linux/Mac support planned)                              |
| Hardware Cost      | <$30 (Arduino + USB host shield)                                       |
